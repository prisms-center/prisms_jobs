    """Represents a computational job

    Initialize either with all the parameters, or with 'substr' a submit script as a string.
    If 'substr' is given, all other arguments are ignored.

    Args:
        substr (str): A submit script as a string.
        name (str): Job name. Ex: ``"myjob-0"``

            The name specified may be up to and including 15 characters
            in length. It must consist of printable, non white space characters
            with the first character alphabetic.

        account (str):  Account name. Ex: ``"prismsproject_fluxoe"``
        nodes (int):    Number of nodes. Ex: 2
        ppn (int):      Processors per node. Ex: 16
        walltime (str): Walltime (``HH:MM:SS``). Ex: ``"10:00:00"``
        pmem (str):     Memory requsted. Ex: ``"3800mb"``
        qos (str):      Ex: ``"flux"``
        queue (str):    Ex: ``"fluxoe"``
        exclude (str):  Nodes to exclude (slurm only). Ex: ``"node01,node02,node03"``

        exetime (str):  Time after which the job is eligible for execution. Ex: ``"1100"``

            Has the form: ``[[[[CC]YY]MM]DD]hhmm[.SS]``
            Create using ``prisms_jobs.misc.exetime(deltatime)``, where deltatime
            is a ``[[[DD:]MM:]HH:]SS`` string.

        message (str):  When to send email about the job. Ex: ``"abe"``

            The mail_options argument is a string which consists of either the single
            character ``"n"``, or one or more of the characters ``"a"``, ``"b"``,
            and ``"e"``.

            If the character ``"n"`` is specified, no normal mail is sent. Mail for job
            cancels and other events outside of normal job processing are still sent.

            For the letters ``"a"``, ``"b"``, and ``"e"``:

               ===    ===
                a     mail is sent when the job is aborted by the batch system.
                b     mail is sent when the job begins execution.
                e     mail is sent when the job terminates.
               ===    ===

        email (str):  Where to send notifications.  Ex: ``"jdoe@umich.edu"``

            The email string is of the form: ``user[@host][,user[@host],...]``

        priority (str):  Priority ranges from (low) -1024 to (high) 1023. Ex: ``"-200"``

        command (str):   String with command to run by script. Ex: ``"echo \"hello\" > test.txt"``

        auto (bool, optional, Default=False):

            Indicates an automatically re-submitting job.  Ex: ``True``

            Only set to True if the command uses this prisms_jobs module to set
            itself as completed when it is completed. Otherwise, you may submit
            it extra times leading to wasted resources and overwritten data.

    Attributes:
        name (str): Job name. Ex: ``"myjob-0"``
        account (str):  Account name. Ex: ``"prismsproject_fluxoe"``
        nodes (int):    Number of nodes. Ex: 2
        ppn (int):      Processors per node. Ex: 16
        walltime (str): Walltime (``HH:MM:SS``). Ex: ``"10:00:00"``
        pmem (str):     Memory requsted. Ex: ``"3800mb"``
        qos (str):      Ex: ``"flux"``
        queue (str):    Ex: ``"fluxoe"``
        exclude (str):  Nodes to exclude (slurm only). Ex: ``"node01,node02,node03"``
        exetime (str):  Time after which the job is eligible for execution. Ex: ``"1100"``
        message (str):  When to send email about the job. Ex: ``"abe"``
        email (str):  Where to send notifications.  Ex: ``"jdoe@umich.edu"``
        priority (str):  Priority ranges from (low) -1024 to (high) 1023. Ex: ``"-200"``
        constraint (str): Constraint. Ex: ``"haswell"``
        command (str):   String with command to run by script. Ex: ``"echo \"hello\" > test.txt"``
        auto (bool):     Indicates an automatically re-submitting job.  Ex: ``True``
